# Status1A_Life_Expectancy
Within this project will be contained all of the code I used for the analysis in my "Life expectancy without a transplant of status 1A liver transplant candidates" (Currently undergoing revisions for publication in the American Journal of Transplantation). To do the analysis, I assume the user of this code will have access to the following standard analysis files from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients:  

can_liin.dta, stathist_liin.dta, statjust_li1.dta
